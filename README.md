# Genetic-Algorithm
This is my first finished optimization algorithm developed. Supervised by my optimization teacher, Juanfran, from the University of Valencia.

We started this project on 20th of July of 2022, when I finished the first year of my degree. We are developing different optimization algorithms and this one was the firts.

This algorith solve a Knapsack problem (KP) with 2 backpacks with different (or same) weight.
The parameters of the problem has to be written in a txt file.
The first row of the file has the 2 weigths separated by semicolons (;)
The rest of the file are the different objects
Each object has an id, weigth and value, in that order separated by ;

After the algorithm runs you'll have to wait a little in order to have a
better solution

The parameters of the main function can be changed as you like
Think that higher parameters mean more time of execution but also mean 
a better solution

Enjoy the algorithm
